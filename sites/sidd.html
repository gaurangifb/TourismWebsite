    <h2><u>DESCRIPTION</u></h2>
    <P>The Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati Mandir is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shri Ganesh. It is located in Prabhadevi, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. It was originally built by Laxman Vithu and Deubai Patil on 19 November 1801. It is one of the richest temples in India. The temple has a small mandap with the shrine for Siddhi Vinayak ("Ganesha who grants your wish"). The wooden doors to the sanctum are carved with images of the Ashtavinayak (the eight manifestations of Ganesha in Maharashtra). The inner roof of the sanctum is plated with gold, and the central statue is of Ganesha. In the periphery, there is a Hanuman temple as well. The exterior of the temple consists of a dome which is lit up with multiple colors in the evenings and they keep changing every few hours. The statue of Shri Ganesha is located exactly under the dome. The pillars are carved out with the images of ashtvinayak.</P>
    

    <p>In the later half of the twentieth century the Siddhivinayak Mandir evolved from a small shrine to the grand temple of today.[citation needed] The temple owes its fame to politicians as well as Bollywood stars seeking the blessings of Lord Ganesha. Siddhivinayak is well known as "Navsacha Ganapati" or "Navasala Pavanara Ganapati" ('Ganapati bestows whenever humbly genuinely prayed a wish') among devotees. Facilities for performing different kind of puja are made available by the temple authorities.</p>

    <h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
    <p>It was constructed on 19 November 1801. The original structure of the Siddhivinayak Temple was a small 3.6 meter x 3.6 meters square brick structure with a dome-shaped brick shikhara. The temple was built by the contractor Laxman Vithu Patil. The building was funded by a rich Agri woman named Deubai Patil. Childless due to infertility, Deaubai built the temple so that Ganesha should grant children to other infertile women. Ramakrishna Jambhekar Maharaj, a disciple of the Hindu saint Akkalkot Swami Samarth, buried two divine idols in the front of the presiding deity of the temple on the orders of his guru. It is claimed that after 21 years of the burial of the icons, a mandar tree grew at that spot with a svayambhu Ganesha in its branches – as prophesied by Swami Samartha.</p>

    <p>The 2550 temple complex had two 3.6 meter Deepamalas, a rest house and living quarters for the caretaker. It had an adjoining lake, 30 x 40 square meters in size on the eastern and southern side of the temple. The lake, dug by Nardulla in the early 19th century to counter the scarcity of water, was filled up in the later years and the land is now not part of the temple complex. Around 1952, a small Hanuman shrine was built in the temple complex for the Hanuman icon that was found during the road extension project of Sayani Road near Elphinstone Road. In the 1950s and 60s, the fame of the temple spread and a significant number of devotees began visiting. However, in the same period, the owner of the plot sold some of the temple land, reducing the complex area. After 1975, the number of devotees increased dramatically.</p>


    <p>Old structure of the shrine was very small and day by day it was becoming inconvenient for the growing number of devotees to seek Shree’s Darshan i.e. the blissful sight of the Lord Ganesh. Maximum of 15-20 devotees could be accommodated to seek Darshan. With an objective to provide the facilities of easy and fast Darshan, satisfaction of services and devotion including facilities for offerings and various ritual procedures, it was planned to expand and renovate the existing shrine structure. On an auspicious day of Akshay Tritiya- Vaishakh Shuddha Tritiya of Samvatsar 1916 i.e. on the 27th April 1990, Foundation Stone for the proposed project was laid by the then Chief Minister Shri Sharad chandraji Pawar. The present magnificent and palatial building was finally completed after overcoming several difficulties. Kalas (Dome) Pratishthapana of the Vaastu was performed and celebrated on a sublimate grand scale. This event was inaugurated by the then Chief Minister Shri Sharad chandraji Pawar. The rituals of Kalas Pratishthapana – the Apex Induction ceremony were performed by reverent Jagadguru Shri Shankaracharya Dakshinamnay Shri Sharadapeeth Shrungeri Shri Shri 1008 Bharatiteertha Mahaswamiji on the auspicious day of Jyeshth Shuddha Chaturthi of samvatsar 1916, i.e. Monday, the 13th June 1994. This day is recorded in the 200 years history of the shrine as the most memorable day.</p>
