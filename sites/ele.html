    <h2><u>DESCRIPTION</u></h2>
    <P>The Elephanta Caves are located in Western India on Elephanta Island (otherwise known as the Island of Gharapuri), which features two hillocks separated by a narrow valley. The small island is dotted with numerous ancient archaeological remains that are the sole testimonies to its rich cultural past. These archaeological remains reveal evidence of occupation from as early as the 2nd century BC. The rock-cut Elephanta Caves were constructed about the mid-5th to 6th centuries AD. The most important among the caves is the great Cave 1, which measures 39 metres from the front entrance to the back. In plan, this cave in the western hill closely resembles Dumar Lena cave at Ellora, in India. The main body of the cave, excluding the porticos on the three open sides and the back aisle, is 27 metres square and is supported by rows of six columns each. </P>
    

    <p>The 7-metre-high masterpiece “Sadashiva” dominates the entrance to Cave 1. The sculpture represents three aspects of Shiva: the Creator, the Preserver, and the Destroyer, identified, respectively, with Aghora or Bhairava (left half), Taptapurusha or Mahadeva (central full face), and Vamadeva or Uma (right half). Representations of Nataraja, Yogishvara, Andhakasuravadha, Ardhanarishwara, Kalyanasundaramurti, Gangadharamurti, and Ravanaanugrahamurti are also noteworthy for their forms, dimensions, themes, representations, content, alignment and execution.</p>

    <h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
    <p>The Elephanta Caves are situated in the middle of Mumbai Harbour, off the coast of Mumbai. Three different names knew the island during ancient times. It was called Gharapuri or Gharapur Island, which means City of Caves, Sonapuri, and Elpata. The ancient Indians believed Shiva established his lingam at this site and created a new era – the ‘Shanivar era.’
    Two teams worked on Elephanta caves in its long history- one during the 5th century and another before the 15th century. Most of it is attributed to the former team as they have found more proof for their work done than others. During the Mauryan dynasty, in the 5th century, the two brothers, Manku and Charanku, worked on this site. They were responsible for creating rock-cut temples here, called Caves 1 to 6. </p>

    <p>Historians believe they belonged to a non-Aryan tribe called ‘Mallas’, who ruled over large parts of ancient India between the 6th c BC to 12th c AD. The second team was probably from outside Maharashtra. Historians have found evidence suggesting that people of Konkan used to call themselves ‘Konkana.’ This word resembles the Kannada language where ‘Ko’ means same while ‘na’ means land. Hence, Ko-na-nak-desa gives Konkan. Historians believe that the second team probably belongs to the Kannada-speaking Kanarese people, who were responsible for reviving the ancient glory of Elephanta by making new shrines and sculptures in the 10th century.</p>
