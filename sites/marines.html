    <h2><u>DESCRIPTION</u></h2>
    <P>Marine Drive is a 3 kilometre-long Promenade along the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road in Mumbai, India. The road and promenade were constructed by Pallonji Mistry. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast of a natural bay. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Girgaon Chowpatty and the adjacent road along links Nariman Point at southern tip to Babulnath and Malabar Hill at northern tip. Marine Drive is situated on reclaimed land facing west-south-west. Marine Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace because, when viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace. The official name for this road, though rarely used, is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road. The promenade is lined with palm trees. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Chowpatty Beach. This is a popular beach famed for its Bhel Puri (local fast food). Many restaurants also line this stretch of the road. Further down this road lies Walkeshwar, a wealthy neighborhood of the city, also home to the Governor of Maharashtra. </P>
    

    <p>Most of the buildings erected by wealthy Parsis were constructed in an art deco style, which was popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Among the earliest art deco buildings on Marine Drive were the Kapur Mahal, Zaver Mahal and Keval Mahal, built between 1937 and 1939 for a total cost of 1 million rupees. Real estate prices along the Esplanade are high. Many hotels dot the drive, most prominent among them being the 5-star Oberoi (formerly the Oberoi Hilton Tower however reverted to the original name as of early 2008), The Intercontinental, Hotel Marine Plaza, Sea Green Hotel and a few other smaller hotels. Marine Drive is the preferred connecting road between the central business district located at Nariman Point and the rest of the city. Many Sports Clubs, some of cricket stadium and club grounds are situated along the stretch of Marine Drive, including members-only clubs like the Cricket Club of India (CCI), adjoining the Brabourne Stadium, Hindu Gymkhana Ground and Garware Club House, adjacent to the famous Wankhede Stadium, as well as others like the Mumbai Police Gymkhana, Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Islam Gymkhana.</p>

    <h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
    <p>The construction of the Marine Drive was basically one of the multiple parts of the Back Bay Reclamation Scheme of the British Government. The main plan was to dredge the water body and dump boulders into it in order to obtain more land for the westward expansion of the city. The history of Marine Drive dates back to 1915 when the construction was started at Girgaum Chowpatty, which was earlier known as Kennedy Sea Face. The several Art Deco buildings in the vicinity came up later between 1930 and 1940 as the stretch extended across five miles.</p>

    <p>It was eagerly embraced by the wealthy folks, silver screen stars, and the Parsi immigrants who went on constructing alongside the Marine Drive. Apart from these, Wealthy Hindus who were the immigrants from Pakistan during the 1947 Partition and a handful of Kuwaiti Royals also fabricated Arte Deco Buildings around the Marine Drive. In the vacillating sixties, Marine Drive became the vital center of the nightlife of the city. People used to enjoy their nightlife in restaurants, pubs, bars, and clubs in the city. In 1996, after the renaming of Bombay to Mumbai, several roads were also renamed to remove the persistent expatriate nuances which steered to the rechristening of Marine Drive to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road. Due to the premier whereabouts of the boulevard and dearth of space, the value of the ancient Arte Deco buildings has grasped a massive rate of 2 million and more. Apart from knowing that it is one of the important tourist destinations in Mumbai, here are a few things that are usually not known to tourists about Marine Drive.</p>
