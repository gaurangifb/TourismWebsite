    <h2><u>DESCRIPTION</u></h2>
    <P>The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, formerly known as Victoria Terminus Station, in Mumbai, is an outstanding example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture in India, blended with themes deriving from Indian traditional architecture. The building, designed by the British architect F. W. Stevens, became the symbol of Bombay as the ‘Gothic City’ and the major international mercantile port of India. The terminal was built over 10 years, starting in 1878, according to a High Victorian Gothic design based on late medieval Italian models. Its remarkable stone dome, turrets, pointed arches and eccentric ground plan are close to traditional Indian palace architecture. It is an outstanding example of the meeting of two cultures, as British architects worked with Indian craftsmen to include Indian architectural tradition and idioms thus forging a new style unique to Bombay.</P>

    <h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
    <p>TChhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), formerly known as Victoria Terminus (VT), is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a historic railway station located in the heart of Mumbai. Built in 1888, the station is a grand reminder of the British Raj in India and still one of the most historical landmarks within the Central Business District of Mumbai. It has been a core witness to the city flourishing, businesses blooming, and the Indian film industry growing. It has seen the transition of Bombay to Mumbai. Let’s learn more about this historical gem.</p>

    <p>Designed by the British architect F. W. Stevens, CST is an outstanding example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture in India, blended with themes deriving from Indian traditional architecture. The structure represents the heart of the mercantile facet of the city and also symbolizes the British Commonwealth. CST has been associated with Mumbai since time immemorial.</p>

    <p>In the past, ‘Bori Bandar’ station, located in Eastern Mumbai, was the main station for all commercial and trade activities in the city. In the 1850s, the Great Indian Peninsular Railway operated in this area, which gave it the name ‘Bori Bandar,’ starting its first rail service covering a total distance of 34 kilometers to Thane. It was during the British Rule that it was re-designed by F. W. Stevens, who named it Victoria Terminus (VT), after the then-reigning Queen Victoria. In 1996, the Minister of Railways, Suresh Kalmadi, changed the name of the station to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, in honor of great Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire.</p>
