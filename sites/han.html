    <h2><u>DESCRIPTION</u></h2>
    <P>The Hanging Gardens, in Mumbai, also known as Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens, are terraced gardens perched at the top of Malabar Hill, on its western side, just opposite the Kamala Nehru Park. They provide sunset views over the Arabian Sea and feature numerous hedges carved into the shapes of animals. The park was designed and laid out in 1881 by Ulhas Ghapokar over Bombay's main reservoir, some say to cover the water from the potentially contaminating activity of the nearby Towers of Silence. When seen from the air, the walkway inside the park (Hanging Gardens Path), spell out the letters PMG (Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens) in cursive.</P>

    <h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
    <p>The Hanging Gardens, one of the most relaxing places to visit in Mumbai, dates back to 1881. This century-old garden was designed and laid out by Ulhas Ghapokar over the main water reservoir of Mumbai. It is believed that the garden was designed to serve a deeper purpose than just being a beautiful space for relaxation. It was created to protect the city’s drinking water from getting contaminated from the activities taking place at the nearby Tower of Silence, a funerary tower where the Parsis or Zoroastrians left the dead bodies of their community members for excarnation as per their tradition. </p>

    <p>The garden was officially named as the Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens in honor of Pherozeshah Mehta, a well-known lawyer, social activist, and politician. He was also known as the Lion of Bombay. In 1920, the garden was renovated and revamped to enhance its beauty and several attractions were also added over the last few decades. </p>
