    <h2><u>DESCRIPTION</u></h2>
    <P>The Gateway of India is an arch monument built during the 20th century in Bombay, India. The monument was erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder on their visit to India in 1911. Built in Indo-Saracenic style, the foundation stone for the Gateway of India was laid on 31 March 1911. The structure is an arch made of basalt, 26 metres (85 feet) high. The final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924. The Gateway was later used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay.  It served to allow entry and access to India. The Gateway of India is located on the waterfront at Apollo Bunder area at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea. The monument has also been referred to as the Taj Mahal of Mumbai, and is the city’s top tourist attraction.</P>
    

    <p>Built of honey-colored basalt, the Gateway of India resembles a conventional triumphal arch in concept, but architecturally it is Indo-Saracenic in style, modeled on 16th-century Gujarati work. This absorption of Mughal influences was consciously done, with a view to suggesting the link with earlier rulers and thus arguing for the legitimacy of British colonial rule. Intricate latticework decorates the walls, and four turrets surround an imposing central dome that is 50 feet (15 m) in diameter and rises to 85 feet (26 m) high. Side chambers and halls were added to accommodate civic receptions. The building was opened to the public on December 4, 1924, by the viceroy of India, Rufus Isaacs, earl of Reading Within a generation, this grand symbol of empire also became an epitaph: the last British regiment to leave India after the country’s independence in 1947, the First Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry, passed through the Gateway of India before setting sail for England on February 28, 1948. Today the gateway is one of India’s most popular tourist sites.</p>

    <h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
    <p>The main objective behind the construction of the Gateway of India was to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Bombay (Mumbai). In March 1911, Sir George Sydenham Clarke, who was then the Governor of Bombay, laid down the monument's first foundation. Although, this plan was approved only in 1914, the reclamations at Apollo Bunder were completed only in 1919. The architectural design of Gateway of India was fashioned by architect, George Wittet. It took 4 years to complete this monument's construction.</p>

    <p>The gateway was built to commemorate the arrival of George V, Emperor of India and Mary of Teck, Empress consort, in India at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai (then Bombay) on 2 December 1911 prior to the Delhi Durbar of 1911; it was the first visit of a British monarch to India. However, they only got to see a cardboard model of the monument, as construction did not begin until 1915. The foundation stone for the gateway was laid on 31 March 1913 by then governor of Bombay, Sir George Sydenham Clarke with the final design of George Wittet for the gateway sanctioned in August 1914. Before the gateway's construction, Apollo Bunder used to serve as a native fishing ground. Between 1915 and 1919 work continued at the Apollo Bunder to reclaim the land on which the gateway was to be built, along with the construction of a sea wall. Gammon India had undertaken construction work for the gateway. Its foundations were completed in 1920 while construction was finished in 1924. The gateway was opened to the public on 4 December 1924 by the then viceroy, Rufus Isaacs.</p>

    <p>Gateway of India is celebrated for its unique and intricate Indo-Saracenic architecture. Travellers who wish to learn about its history and take pictures with it will not be disappointed after visiting it. Once you spent ample time admiring its splendour, visitors can enjoy a leisurely walk down the corniche and enjoy the gentle breeze blowing in from the Arabian Sea. If you visit during the evening, you can also enjoy the stunning sight of the sun disappearing over the horizon and lighting up the sky in dazzling colours. At sunset, Gateway of India is lit up in vibrant colours too. On special occasions, it is lit up to commemorate the occasion, like being lit up in the tricolour representing the Indian flag on Independence Day and Republic Day.
